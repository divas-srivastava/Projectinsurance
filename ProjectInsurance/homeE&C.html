        <center><h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2></center>
        <p>Home loan eligibility differs across lending institutions and loan schemes. However, a common set of housing loan eligibility criteria is given below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Indian Residents, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Preferably 750 and above</li>
            <li><strong>Age Limit:</strong> 18 - 70 years</li>
            <li><strong>Work Experience:</strong> At least 2 years (for salaried)</li>
            <li><strong>Business Continuity:</strong> At least 3 years (for self-employed)</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Salary:</strong> At least Rs. 25,000 per month (varies across lenders & locations)</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Up to 90% of property value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Home Purchase Loan is to take a loan to buy ready-to-move-in properties like row houses, flats, etc., under-construction properties, and pre-owned homes/resale properties.</p>
        <p>Composite Loan can be opted to buy a plot and build a house on it. The loan amount comes in slots depending on the stages of construction. The first disbursement in composite loan is made towards plot purchase. Subsequent payments/disbursements depend on the stages of construction of the house.</p>
        <p>Home Construction Loan is offered to individuals for house construction if you own a plot already. The disbursements depend on the stages of construction of the house.</p>
        <p>Home Renovation/ Improvement Loan is for meeting home renovation costs of an existing house. The interest rate for a home renovation/improvement loan and a regular home loan are usually the same.</p>
        <p>Home Extension Loan is for those requiring funds to extend or add more space by adding more floors to their existing house.</p>
        <p>Bridge Loan is a short-term home loan if you are planning to buy a new house with the sale proceeds of your existing house.</p>
        <p>Interest Saver Loan is a home loan overdraft wherein the borrowersâ€™ home loan account is linked to borrowers' bank account. Any amount deposited in the bank account over and above the EMI is considered as a prepayment towards the loan, thus, saving on the interest amount.</p>
        <p>Step Up Loan allows borrowers to pay lower EMIs during the initial years of the loan tenure and have the provision of increasing the EMI amount over time.</p>
