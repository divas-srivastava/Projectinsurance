            Eligibility criteria for business loans can vary by lender and type of loan, but common requirements typically include:

            <li> Business Age: Many lenders prefer businesses that have been operational for at least 1-2 years. </li>

            <li> Credit Score: A good personal and/or business credit score is often required. Generally, a score of 650 or
            higher is considered favorable. </li>

            <li> Business Revenue: Lenders usually look for a minimum annual revenue, which can vary significantly depending
            on the loan size. </li>

            <li> Financial Statements: You may need to provide financial documents, such as profit and loss statements,
            balance sheets, and tax returns. </li>

            <li> Business Plan: A solid business plan demonstrating how the loan will help grow the business can be
            important. </li>

            <li> Collateral: Some loans may require collateral, such as assets or inventory, to secure the loan. </li>

            <li> Industry Type: Certain industries may face more scrutiny or restrictions based on lender policies. </li>

            <li> Ownership and Management: Lenders may evaluate the experience and background of the business owner(s). </li>

            <li> Legal Compliance: The business must comply with local, state, and federal regulations. </li>

            Always check with specific lenders for their exact criteria, as requirements can differ widely.
